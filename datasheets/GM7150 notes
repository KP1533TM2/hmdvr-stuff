Pin 28, WTF?!
=============

I found this pin to be pulled low through a near-zero ohm resistor.
It's active low on the TI chip, so WTF? It means the chip is in power-down.

Datasheet says this:
功耗模式控制， 端口内部带pull-up 电阻
0: 低功耗
1: 正常模式

Which google translates to this:
Power mode control, the port with pull-up resistance inside
0: Low power consumption
1: Normal mode

...which means it's in low-power mode at all times.

PDN = 0,


Sync signals
=============

so the horizontal sync, pin 25 is outputting 50Hz vsync
and the vsync pin 24 is ouputting the same goddamn thing
pin 26 shows actual 15.625K hsync pulses (positive)

ALL of those are still active when there's noise on the input!
