Bits and pieces of HMDVR "DVR for drones"

Just my little "spare time in the eveining one day" effort to figure out as much things as I can
about the thing that is a HMDVR, well, a Chinese DVR that's being sold in probably many places
such as banggood, aliexpress and ebay.
Since later revisions (probably because of video decoder IC change) it stopped recording
noisy video properly and is now partially, well, unfit for purspose of recording "drone" 
(or, infact any other R/C model) video, since being analog, it's almost never noiseless.
It does record that video, but as the signal starts being weakened and polluted with noise, the
video turns into a black screen epillepsy-fest. That's basically why I'm doing all of this :P

One could attach the box to the model itself and get great video, but one could also attach
a proper action camera to get much better recording quality. This HMDVR box thingy, while attached
to goggles or ground station, could give one an advantage of always having a copy of FPV video on
the ground, as long as the video downlink works, which in turn might help one to locate his model
in case of, say, crash.
It's also a much neater (although, a little less video quality-wise) alternative to fiddling with
a laptop, VRx and an USB capture card in the field.
